Game Streaming and Purchasing Platform.

Welcome to our game streaming and purchasing platform repository! This project is developed as part of the Information Technology Project (ITP) module in our year 2 semester 2 curriculum, with a team of 8 members collaborating to bring this vision to life. Our aim is to develop a comprehensive website that offers a wide range of entertainment options to users, tapping into the growing trend of online gaming and streaming services. With the proliferation of streaming platforms, efficient management systems are crucial for handling various aspects of the platform effectively.
